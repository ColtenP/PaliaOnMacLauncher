# Palia On Mac Launcher

This is a launcher that is an alternative to the launcher provided by Palia.
It is written with a Rust Framework that does not seem to work very well with
Whisky/Wine/GamePortingToolKit.

This launcher is intended to be ran inside of a Whisky/Wine environment.

You will need to install the VC2015 C++ Redistributable Package for this to work,
and for Palia to work.
